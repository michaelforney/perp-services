These are some scripts for use with [perp][]. To install, copy them to your
PERP_BASE (usually /etc/perp).

To enable the service, set the sticky bit with chmod +t.

If you are using my [supervisor-utils][] package, a suitable rc.log can be
found in ${PERP_BASE}/.default/rc.log. You can enable logging for a particular
service by creating a symlink to ../.default/rc.log in the service directory.
